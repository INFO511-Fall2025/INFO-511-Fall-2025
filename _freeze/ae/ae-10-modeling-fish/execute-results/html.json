Add appropriate labels to the plot.\n\n::: {#plot-hw .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   If you were to draw a a straight line to best represent the relationship between the heights and weights of fish, where would it go?\n    Why?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n    -   Now, let Python draw the line for you. Refer to the documentation at <https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html>. Specifically, refer to the `method` section.\n\n\n    ::: {#plot-hw-lm .cell execution_count=3}\n    ``` {.python .cell-code}\n    # add code here\n    ```\n    :::\n    \n    \n    -   What types of questions can this plot help answer?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n-   We can use this line to make predictions.\n    Predict what you think the weight of a fish would be with a height of 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm.\n    Which prediction is considered extrapolation?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n    -   What is a residual?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n## Model fitting\n\n-   Fit a model to predict fish weights from their heights.\n\n::: {#fit-model .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Predict what the weight of a fish would be with a height of 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm using this model.\n\n::: {#predict-by-hand .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Calculate predicted weights for all fish in the data and visualize the residuals under this model.\n\n::: {#residuals .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Model summary\n\n-   Display the model summary including estimates for the slope and intercept along with measurements of uncertainty around them. Show how you can extract these values from the model output.\n\n::: {#model-summary .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Write out your model using mathematical notation.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n## Correlation\n\nWe can also assess correlation between two quantitative variables.\n\n-   What is correlation?\n    What are values correlation can take?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n    -   Are you good at guessing correlation? Give it a try! <https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/guesscorrelation/GuessCorrelation.html>\n\n-   What is the correlation between heights and weights of fish?\n\n::: {#correlation .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Adding a third variable\n\n-   Does the relationship between heights and weights of fish change if we take into consideration species? Plot two separate straight lines for the Bream and Roach species.\n\n::: {#plot-hws-lm .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Fitting other models\n\n-   We can fit more models than just a straight line. Change the `sns.regplot()` code you previously used to include `lowess=True`. What is different from the plot created before?\n\n::: {#plot-hw-loess .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
