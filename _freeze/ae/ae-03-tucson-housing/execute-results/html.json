Your narrative should touch on whether having a garage \"makes a difference\" in terms of the price of the house.\n\n::: {#price-garage .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n*Add narrative here.*\n\n::: callout-important\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nIt's expected that within any given market, larger houses will be priced higher.\nIt's also expected that the age of the house will have an effect on the price.\nHowever, in some markets new houses might be more expensive while in others new construction might mean \"no character\" and hence be less expensive.\nSo your family friends ask: \"In Tucson, do houses that are bigger and more expensive tend to be newer ones than those that are smaller and cheaper?\"\n\nOnce again, data visualization skills to the rescue!\n\n-   Create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between `price` and `area`, conditioning for `year_built`.\n\n-   Use `sns.scatterplot()` to create the scatter plot and `lowess` from `statsmodels` to add a LOWESS smooth curve fit to the data.\n\n-   Include informative title, axis, and legend labels.\n\n-   Discuss each of the following claims (1-2 sentences per claim).\n    Your discussion should touch on specific things you observe in your plot as evidence for or against the claims.\n\n    -   Claim 1: Larger houses are priced higher.\n\n    -   Claim 2: Newer houses are priced higher.\n\n    -   Claim 3: Bigger and more expensive houses tend to be newer ones than smaller and cheaper ones.\n\n::: {#price-area .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n*Add narrative here.*\n\n::: callout-important\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n",
