Complete all the preparation work before class.\n\n2.  Ask questions.\n\n3.  Do the readings.\n\n4.  Do the lab.\n\n5.  Don’t procrastinate – at least on a weekly basis!\n\n# Course toolkit\n\n## Course toolkit {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Course operation**\n\n-   Materials: [datasciaz.netlify.app](https://datasciaz.netlify.app/)\n-   Submission: GitHub\n-   Discussion: Slack\n-   Gradebook: D2L\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Doing data science**\n\n-   Computing:\n    -   Python\n    -   VS Code\n    -   Quarto/Jupyter\n-   Version control and collaboration:\n    -   Git\n    -   GitHub\n:::\n:::\n\n# Toolkit: Computing\n\n## Learning goals {.smaller}\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to...\n\n::: incremental\n-   gain insight from data\n-   gain insight from data, **reproducibly**\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques\n:::\n\n# Reproducible data analysis\n\n## Reproducibility checklist {.smaller}\n\n::: question\nWhat does it mean for a data analysis to be \"reproducible\"?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Short-term goals:**\n\n-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?\n-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?\n-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?\n\n. . .\n\n**Long-term goals:**\n\n-   Can the code be used for other data?\n-   Can you extend the code to do other things?\n\n## Toolkit for reproducibility\n\n-   Scriptability $\\rightarrow$ Python\n-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\\rightarrow$ Quarto/Jupyter\n-   Version control $\\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub\n\n# Python and Jupyter\n\n## Python and Jupyter {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/python.jpeg){fig-alt=\"R logo\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100\"}\n\n-   Python is an open-source general purpose **programming language**\n-   Python is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics\n-   It's easily extensible with *packages*\n:::\n\n::: {.column .fragment width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/Jupyter_logo.svg){fig-alt=\"RStudio logo\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100\"}\n\n-   Jupyter is a convenient interface for Python called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *\"I write Python code in the Jupyter IDE\"*\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Jupyter is not a requirement for programming with Python, but it's very commonly used by Python programmers and data scientists\n:::\n:::\n\n## Python vs. Jupyter\n\n[![](images/python_vs_jupyter.png){fig-alt=\"On the left: a car engine.
