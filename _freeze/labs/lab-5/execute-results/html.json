Probability and you\n\n### Question 1\n\nWe use probabilities all the time when making decisions.\n*As a group*, provide *two* real world examples of when you've used probability to make decisions in your every day life.\nThink critically.\nBe creative.\n\n## Part 2 - Risk of coronary heart disease\n\nThis data set is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.\nWe want to examine the relationship between various health characteristics and the risk of having heart disease.\n\n### Question 2\n\nLoad in the data set called `education-disease` and answer the following questions below.\n\n### Question 3\n\nHow many levels of education are there in these data?\nHow many levels of disease are there?\n**Hint:** The `unique()` function might be helpful.\n\n### Question 4\n\nConvert the data to a two-way table where each cell is the number of people falling into each combination of Disease and Education.\n**Hint:** Use `groupby` and `pivot_table`.\nYour answer should be a 4x3 data frame with counts in each cell.\n\n::: {#a892610a .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# add code here.\n```\n:::\n\n\nUsing the summary table you created above, answer the remaining questions.\nYou do not have to use Python functions for your calculations, you can use Python as a calculator using the values from the summary table.\nMake sure to show your work, i.e., instead of reporting just the final answer, use Python to calculate that in a way we can see the counts you've used along the way.\n\n### Question 5\n\nWhat is the probability of a random individual having high school or GED education and not being high risk for cardiovascular disease?\n\n### Question 6\n\nWhat is the probability that a random individual who is already high risk for cardiovascular disease has a college education?\n\n## Part 3 - Bike rentals\n\nBike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.\nYou are tasked to investigate the relationship between the temperature outside and the number of bikes rented in the Washington DC area between the years 2011 and 2022.\nYou will be investigating data for the months June, July, September, and November.\n\nBelow is a list of variables and their definitions:\n\n| Variable  | Definition                                                                     |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `season`  | Numerical representation of Spring (2), Summer (3), and Fall (4)               |\n| `year`    | Numerical representation of 2011 (0) or 2012 (1)                               |\n| `month`   | Month in which data were collected                                             |\n| `holiday` | Indicator variable for whether data were collected on a holiday (1) or not (0) |\n| `weekday` | Numerical representation of day of week                                        |\n| `temp`    | Temperature in Celsius                                                         |\n| `count`   | Number of bike rentals for that day                                            |\n\n### Question 7\n\n(a) Read in the `bike` data.\n    Then, create a scatter plot that investigates the relationship between the number of bikes rented and the temperature outside.\n    Include a straight line of best fit to help discuss the discovered relationship.\n    Summarize your findings in 2-3 sentences.\n\n(b) Another researcher suggests to look at the relationship between bikes rented and temperature by each of the four months of interest.\n    Recreate your plot in part a, and color the points by month.\n    Include a straight line for each of the four months to help discuss each month's relationship between bikes rented and temperature.\n    In 3-4 sentences, summarize your findings.\n\nPlease watch the following video on Simpson's Paradox [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebEkn-BiW5k).\nAfter you do, please answer the following questions.\n\n### Question 8\n\nIn your own words, summarize Simpson's Paradox in 2-3 sentences.\n\n### Question 9\n\nCompare and contrast your findings from part (a) and part (b).\nWhat's different?\n\n### Question 10\n\nThink critically about your answer to part d.\nWhat other context from this study could be creating this paradox?\nThat is, identify a potential confounding\n\n# Closing an issue with a commit\n\nGo to your GitHub repository, you will see an issue with the title \"Learn to close an issue with a commit\".\n\nYour goal is to close this issue with a commit to practice this workflow, which is the workflow you will use when you are addressing feedback on your projects.\n\n-   Go to the relevant section in your lab .ipynb file.\n-   Delete the sentence that says \"Delete me\".\n-   Render the document.\n-   Commit your changes from the git tab with the commit message *\"Delete sentence, closes #1.\"*\n-   Push your changes to your repo and observe that the issue is now closed and the commit associated with this move is linked from the issue.\n\nGitHub allows you to close an issue directly with commits if the commit uses one of the following keywords followed bu the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title): close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved.\n\n# Wrap-up\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all of your documents are updated on your GitHub repo.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n\nYou must turn in the .ipynb file by the submission deadline to be considered \"on time\".\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\n## Checklist\n\nMake sure you have:\n\n-   attempted all questions\n-   run all code in your Jupyter notebook\n-   committed and pushed everything to your GitHub repository such that the Git pane in VS Code is empty\n:::\n\n## Grading\n\nThe lab is graded out of a total of 50 points.\n\nOn Questions 1 through 10, you can earn up to 5 points on each question:\n\n-   5: Response shows excellent understanding and addresses all or almost all of the rubric items.\n\n-   4: Response shows good understanding and addresses most of the rubric items.\n\n-   3: Response shows understanding and addresses a majority of the rubric items.\n\n-   2: Response shows effort and misses many of the rubric items.\n\n-   1: Response does not show sufficient effort or understanding and/or is largely incomplete.\n\n-   0: No attempt.\n\n",
