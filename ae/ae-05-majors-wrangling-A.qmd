## Goal

Our ultimate goal in this application exercise is to make the following data visualization.

![](images/degrees_plot_final.png){fig-align="center"}

## Data

For this exercise you will work with data on the proportions of Bachelor’s degrees awarded in the US between 2005 and 2015.
The dataset you will use is in your `data/` folder and it’s called `degrees.csv`.

```{python}
#| label: load-packages-data
#| message: false
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

infosci = pd.read_csv("data/degrees.csv")
```

And let's take a look at the data.

```{python}
infosci.head()
```

## Pivoting

-   Pivot the `degrees` data frame *longer* such that each row represents a degree type / year combination and `year` and `n`umber of graduates for that year are columns in the data frame.

```{python}
infosci_long = infosci.melt(id_vars='degree', var_name='year', value_name='n')

infosci_long.info()
```

-   **Question:** What is the type of the `year` variable? Why? What should it be?

It's an `object` variable since the information came from the columns of the original data frame and Python cannot know that these character strings represent years.
The variable type should be numeric (`int64`).

-   Start over with pivoting, and this time also make sure `year` is a numerical variable in the resulting data frame.

```{python}
infosci_long = infosci.melt(id_vars='degree', var_name='year', value_name='n')
infosci_long['year'] = pd.to_numeric(infosci_long['year'])

infosci_long.info()
```

-   **Question:** What does an `NaN` mean in this context? *Hint:* The data come from the university registrar, and they have records on every single graduates, there shouldn't be anything "unknown" to them about who graduated when.

`NA`s should actually be 0s.

-   Add on to your pipeline that you started with pivoting and convert `NaN`s in `n` to `0`s.

```{python}
infosci_long = infosci.melt(id_vars='degree', var_name='year', value_name='n')
infosci_long['year'] = pd.to_numeric(infosci_long['year'])
infosci_long['n'] = infosci_long['n'].fillna(0)

infosci_long.isna().sum()
```

-   In our plot the degree types are BA, BS, MA, MS, and PhD. This information is in our dataset, in the `degree` column, but this column also has additional characters we don’t need. Create a new column called `degree_type` with levels BA, BS, MA, MS, and PhD (in this order) based on `degree`. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{python}
infosci_long = infosci.melt(id_vars='degree', var_name='year', value_name='n')
infosci_long['year'] = pd.to_numeric(infosci_long['year'])
infosci_long['n'] = infosci_long['n'].fillna(0)

infosci_long[['major', 'degree_type']] = infosci_long['degree'].str.split(' \(', expand=True)
infosci_long['degree_type'] = infosci_long['degree_type'].str.replace('\)', '', regex=True)

degree_order = pd.CategoricalDtype(categories=["BA", "BS", "MA", "MS", "PhD"], ordered=True)
infosci_long['degree_type'] = infosci_long['degree_type'].astype(degree_order)

infosci_long.head()
```

-   Now we start making our plot, but let's not get too fancy right away. Create the following plot, which will serve as the "first draft" on the way to our [Goal]. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{python}
sns.set_style("darkgrid")

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=infosci_long, x='year', y='n', hue='degree_type', ci=None, marker='o')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

-   What aspects of the plot need to be updated to go from the draft you created above to the [Goal] plot at the beginning of this application exercise.

    -   x-axis scale: need to go from 2019 to 2023 in unique year values

    -   line colors

    -   axis labels: title, x, y

    -   theme

-   Update x-axis scale such that the years displayed go from 2019 to 2023 in unique years.
    Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=infosci_long, x='year', y='n', hue='degree_type', ci=None, marker='o')
plt.xticks(ticks=infosci_long['year'].unique(), labels=infosci_long['year'].unique())
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

-   Update line colors using the following level / color assignments.
    Once again, do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

    -   BA: "#53868B"

    -   BS: "#7AC5CD"

    -   MA: "#89a285"

    -   MS: "#8B814C"

    -   PhD: "#CDBE70"

```{python}
custom_palette = {
    "BA": "#53868B",
    "BS": "#7AC5CD",
    "MA": "#89a285",
    "MS": "#8B814C",
    "PhD": "#CDBE70"
}

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=infosci_long, x='year', y='n', hue='degree_type', ci=None, marker='o')
plt.xticks(ticks=infosci_long['year'].unique(), labels=infosci_long['year'].unique())
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

-   Update the plot labels (`title`, `x`, and `y`) and use `sns.set_style("white_grid")`. Once again, do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{python}
sns.set_style("whitegrid")

custom_palette = {
    "BA": "#53868B",
    "BS": "#7AC5CD",
    "MA": "#89a285",
    "MS": "#8B814C",
    "PhD": "#CDBE70"
}

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=infosci_long, x='year', y='n', hue='degree_type', ci=None, marker='o', palette=custom_palette)
plt.title('College of Information Science degrees over the years\nAcademic years 2019 - 2023')
plt.xticks(ticks=infosci_long['year'].unique(), labels=infosci_long['year'].unique())
plt.xlabel('Graduation year')
plt.ylabel('Number of students graduating')
plt.legend(title='Degree type')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
