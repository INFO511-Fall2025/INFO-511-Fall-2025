For this application exercise, we'll use the **pandas** and **seaborn** packages.

```{python}
#| label: load-packages

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
```

The dataset we will visualize is called `penguins`.
Let's `.info()` it.

-   **Your turn:** Replace `#add code here` with the code for "info"ing at the data `penguins` data frame â€“ `penguins.info()`. Render the document and view the output.

```{python}
#| label: glimpse-penguins
penguins = sns.load_dataset("data/penguins")
# add code here
```

-   **Demo:** First, replace the blank below with the number of rows in the `penguins` data frame based on the output of the chunk below. Then, replace it with "inline code" and render again.

```{python}
#| label: nrow-penguins

num_rows = len(penguins)
num_rows
```

There are \_\_\_ penguins in the `penguins` data frame.

```{python}
x = 2
x * 3
```
