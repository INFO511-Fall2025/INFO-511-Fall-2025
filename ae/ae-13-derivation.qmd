In this exercise, we will:

-   Practice Basic Differentiation:

    -   Apply the power rule to find the derivatives of simple polynomial functions.

-   Apply the Chain Rule and Product Rule:

    -   Use these rules to differentiate more complex functions involving compositions and products.

-   Solve Advanced Differentiation Problems:

    -   Tackle derivatives of functions with nested compositions and multiple variables, reinforcing the use of the chain rule and product rule.
