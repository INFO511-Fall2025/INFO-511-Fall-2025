# Packages

```{python}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

# Read in Data + wrangle

```{python}
tucson_housing = pd.read_csv("data/tucsonHousing.csv")

garage_types = ["Single Family", "Townhouse"]

tucson_housing['garage'] = tucson_housing['type'].apply(lambda x: 'Garage' if x in garage_types else 'No garage')
```

# Exercise 1

From the histograms, it appears that houses with garages (assumed based on house type) generally have a wider range of prices compared to those without garages.
This suggests that having a garage might be associated with higher or more variable house prices in Tucson.

```{python}
#| label: price-garage
 
g = sns.FacetGrid(tucson_housing, row="garage")
g.map(sns.histplot, "price", kde=False, binwidth=50000)
g.set_axis_labels("Price", "Count")
g.set_titles("{row_name}")
g.fig.suptitle("Distribution of House Prices in Tucson by Garage Availability", y=1.05)
plt.show()
```

# Exercise 2

-   **Claim 1: Larger houses are priced higher.** The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between house area and price, indicating that larger houses tend to be priced higher.

    **Claim 2: Newer houses are priced higher.** From the color gradient, it appears that newer houses (lighter colors) are generally more expensive, supporting the claim that newer houses are priced higher.

    **Claim 3: Bigger and more expensive houses tend to be newer ones than smaller and cheaper ones.** The plot suggests that bigger and more expensive houses are often newer, as indicated by the clustering of lighter-colored points (newer houses) towards the upper right of the plot.

```{python}
#| label: price-area
from statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess import lowess

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
scatter = sns.scatterplot(data=tucson_housing, x='area', y='price', hue='year_built', palette='viridis')

lowess_fit = lowess(tucson_housing['price'], tucson_housing['area'], frac=0.3)
lowess_x = [point[0] for point in lowess_fit]
lowess_y = [point[1] for point in lowess_fit]

plt.plot(lowess_x, lowess_y, color='red', linewidth=2)

plt.title('Relationship between House Price and Area in Tucson, Colored by Year Built')
plt.xlabel('Area (square feet)')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.legend(title='Year Built', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')

plt.show()
```
