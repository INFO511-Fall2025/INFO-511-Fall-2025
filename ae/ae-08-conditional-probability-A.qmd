## Goal

Learn to calculate and interpret the probability of having a disease given a positive test result using sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence data.

## Scenario:

You are provided with the following data for COVID-19 rapid self-administered tests and population statistics from Pima County, Arizona found in Lecture 12.

## **Understand the Definitions**:

-   **Sensitivity** $P(T | D)$: Probability of a positive test given the person has the disease.

-   **Specificity** $P(T^c | D^c)$: Probability of a negative test given the person does not have the disease.

-   **Prevalence** $P(D)$: Probability that a randomly selected person has the disease.

### **Formulate Bayes' Rule**:

$$
P(D | T) = \frac{P(T \text{ and } D)}{P(T)}
$$

We know that:

$$
P(T \text{ and } D) = P(T | D) ⋅ P(D)
$$

And:

$$
P(T) = P(T | D) ⋅ P(D) + P(T | D^c) ⋅ P(D^c)
$$

Where:

$$
P(T | D^c) = 1-P(T^c | D^c)
$$

## Exercises

Using the given data, calculate the probability that an individual has COVID-19 given a positive test result $P(T | D)$.

1.  **Substitute the Given Values:**

    -   **Sensitivity**: $P(T | D)$ = 0.087
    -   **Specificity**: $P(T^c | D^c)$ = 0.642
    -   **Prevalence**: $P(D)$ = 0.998. among persons aged 10 years and older.

2.  **Calculate the Complementary Probabilities**

    -   $P(T | D^c)$: Probability of a positive test given no disease.

        $$P(T | D^c)=1-P(T^c | D^c)$$

        $1 - 0.998 = 0.002$

    -   $P(D^c)$: Probability of not having the disease.

        $$P(D^c) = 1-P(D)$$

        $1 - 0.087 = 0.913$

3.  **Calculate the Probability of a Positive Test** $P(T)$:

$$P(T)=P(T | D)⋅ P(D) + P(T | D^c) ⋅ P(D^c)$$

$P(T)=(0.642×0.087)+(0.002×0.913)$ $P(T)=0.055854+0.001826=0.05768$

4.  **Calculate the Posterior Probability** $P(D | T)$

$$
P(D | T)=\frac{P(T | D) ⋅ P(D)}{P(T | D) ⋅ P(D) + (1-P(T^c | D^c)) ⋅ (1-P(D))}
$$

$P(D∣T)=\frac{0.05768}{0.055854}​≈0.968$

### Discussion Questions:

1.  **Is this calculation surprising?**

    -   Considering the given sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, is the high probability of having the disease given a positive test result unexpected? Why or why not?

-   No, given the high specificity, false positives are minimal, so a positive result is likely accurate.

2.  **What is the explanation?**

    -   Explain why the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is so high. Consider the impact of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.

-   The combination of high specificity and moderate sensitivity ensures that the test reliably rules out non-disease cases, contributing to the high posterior probability.

3.  **Was this calculation actually reasonable to perform?**

    -   Discuss whether it is reasonable to calculate the probability of having the disease based on the given data. Are there any limitations or assumptions in this calculation?

-   Yes, but assumptions such as perfect accuracy of prevalence data and no external biases limit real-world applicability.

4.  **What if we tested in a different population, such as high-risk individuals?**

    -   How might the probability of having the disease given a positive test result change if the test was administered to a population with a higher prevalence of COVID-19?

-   The posterior probability would increase with higher prevalence.

5.  **What if we were to test a random individual in a county where the prevalence of COVID-19 is approximately 25%?**

    -   Recalculate the probability of having the disease given a positive test result for a population with a 25% prevalence of COVID-19. How does this compare to the original calculation?

-   **If prevalence = 25%:**

$P(T) = (0.642 \times 0.25) + (0.002 \times 0.75) = 0.162$

$P(D | T) = \frac{0.1605}{0.162} \approx 0.991​$
