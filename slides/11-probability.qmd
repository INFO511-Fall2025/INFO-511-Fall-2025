## What we've done so far... {.smaller}

-   Use visualization techniques to *visualize* data\
-   Use descriptive statistics to *describe* and *summarize* data
-   Use data wrangling tools to *manipulate* data
-   ...all using the reproducible, shareable tools of Python, Jupyter, and git

That's all great, but what we eventually want to do is to *quantify uncertainty* in order to make **principled conclusions** about the data

## The statistical process {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Statistics is a process that converts data into useful information, where practitioners

::: fragment
1️⃣ form a question of interest,
:::

::: fragment
2️⃣ collect and summarize data,
:::

::: fragment
3️⃣ and interpret the results.

## The population of interest {.small}

The **population** is the group we'd like to learn something about.

::: incremental
-   What is the prevalence of diabetes among **U.S. adults**, and has it changed over time?

-   Does the average amount of caffeine vary by vendor in **12 oz. cups of** **coffee at U of A coffee shops**?

-   Is there a relationship between tumor type and five-year mortality among **breast cancer patients**?
:::

::: fragment
The **research question of interest** is what we want to answer - often relating one or more numerical quantities or summary statistics.
:::

::: fragment
If we had data from every unit in the population, we could just calculate what we wanted and be done!
:::

## Sampling from the population {.smaller}

Unfortunately, we (usually) have to settle with a **sample** from the population.

::: fragment
Ideally, the sample is **representative** (has similar characteristics as the population), allowing us to make conclusions that are **generalizable** (i.e. applicable) to the broader population of interest.
:::

<br>

::: fragment
We'll use probability and statistical inference (more on this later!) to draw conclusions about the population based on our sample.

# Formalizing probabilities {.smaller}

## What do we need? {.smaller}

We can think of probabilities as objects that model random phenomena.
We'll use three components to talk about probabilities:

::: fragment
1️⃣ **Sample space**: the set of all possible **outcomes**
:::

::: fragment
2️⃣ **Events**: Subsets of the sample space, comprise any number of possible outcomes (including none of them!)
:::

::: fragment
3️⃣ **Probability**: Proportion of times an event would occur if we observed the random phenomenon an infinite number of times.
:::

## Sample spaces {.smaller}

Sample spaces depend on the random phenomenon in question

::: incremental
-   Tossing a single fair coin

-   Sum of rolling two fair six-sided dice

-   Guessing the answer on a multiple choice question with choices *a, b, c, d*.
:::

::: fragment
::: question
What are the sample spaces for the random phenomena above?
:::
:::

## Events {.smaller}

**Events** are subsets of the sample space that comprise all possible outcomes from that event.
These are the "plausibly reasonable" outcomes we may want to calculate the probabilities for:

::: incremental
-   Tossing a single fair coin

-   Sum of rolling two fair six-sided dice

-   Guessing the answer on a multiple choice question with choices *a, b, c, d*.
:::

<br>

::: fragment
::: question
What are some examples of events for the random phenomena above?
:::
:::

## Probabilities {.smaller}

Consider the following possible events and their corresponding probabilities:

::: incremental
-   Getting a head from a single fair coin toss: **0.5**
-   Getting a prime number sum from rolling two fair six-sided dice: **5/12**
-   Guessing the correct answer: **1/4**
:::

<br>

::: fragment
*We'll talk more about how we calculated these probabilities, but for now remember that probabilities are numbers describing the likelihood of each event's occurrence, which map events to a number between 0 and 1, inclusive.*
:::

# Working with probabilities

## Set operations {.smaller}

Remember that events are (sub)sets of the outcome space.
For two sets (in this case events) $A$ and $B$, the most common relationships are:

::: incremental
-   **Intersection** $(A \text{ and } B)$: $A$ **and** $B$ both occur
-   **Union** $(A \text{ or } B)$: $A$ **or** $B$ occurs (including when both occur)
-   **Complement** $(A^c)$: $A$ does **not** occur
:::

<br>

::: fragment
Two sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** if they cannot happen at the same time, i.e. $A \text{ and } B = \emptyset$.
:::

## Combining set operations {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**DeMorgan's laws**

::: incremental
-   Complement of union: $(A \text{ or } B)^c = A^c \text{ and } B^c$
-   Complement of intersection: $(A \text{ and } B)^c = A^c \text{ or } B^c$
:::

::: fragment
These can be extended to more than two events

## How do probabilities work? {.smaller}

**Kolmogorov axioms**

::: fragment
✅ The probability of any event is real number that's $\geq 0$
:::

::: fragment
✅ The probability of the entire sample space is 1
:::

::: fragment
✅ If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint events, then $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$
:::

<br>

::: fragment
The Kolmogorov axioms lead to all probabilities being between 0 and 1 inclusive, and also lead to important rules...
:::

## Two important rules {.smaller}

Suppose we have events $A$ and $B$, with probabilities $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ of occurring.
Based on the Kolmogorov axioms:

::: incremental
-   **Complement Rule**: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
-   **Inclusion-Exclusion**: $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$
