## Conditional probability {.smaller}

The probability an event will occur *given* that another event has already occurred is a **conditional probability**.
The conditional probability of event $A$ given event $B$ is:

::: instruction
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}$$
:::

## Conditional probabilities {.smaller}

::: instruction
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}$$
:::

Examples come up all the time in the real world:

::: incremental
-   *Given* that it rained yesterday, what is the probability that it will rain today?
-   *Given* that a mammogram comes back positive, what is the probability that a woman has breast cancer?
-   *Given* that I've already watched six episodes of How I Met Your Mother tonight, what is the probability that I'll get any work done this evening?

::: question
Define events $A$ = died and $B$ = non-coffee drinker.
Calculate the following for a randomly selected person in the cohort:

::: incremental
-   Marginal probability: $P(A)$, $P(B)$

-   Joint probability: $P(A \text{ and } B)$

-   Conditional probability: $P(A | B)$, $P(B | A)$

# Independence

## The multiplicative rule {.smaller}

We can write the definition of condition probability

::: instruction
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}$$
:::

<br>

::: fragment
::: instruction
Using the equation above, we get...

$$P(B) \times P(A | B) = P(A \text{ and } B)$$
:::

**What does the multiplicative rule mean in plain English?**
:::

## Defining independence {.smaller}

Events $A$ and $B$ are said to be **independent** when

$$P(A | B) = P(A) \hspace{10mm} \textbf{OR} \hspace{10mm}
P(B | A) = P(B)$$

<br>

::: fragment
In other words, knowing that one event has occurred doesn't cause us to "adjust" the probability we assign to another event.
:::

## Checking independence {.smaller}

We can use the multiplicative rule to see if two events are independent.

::: instruction
If events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then

$$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$
:::

## Independent vs. disjoint events {.smaller}

Since for two independent events $P(A|B) = P(A)$ and $P(B|A) = P(B)$, knowing that one event has occurred tells us nothing more about the probability of the other occurring.

::: fragment
For two disjoint events $A$ and $B$, knowing that one has occurred tells us that the other definitely has not occurred: $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$.
:::

::: fragment
::: instruction
Disjoint events are <u>not</u> independent!

# Bayes' Rule

## An example {.smaller}

In an introductory statistics course, 50% of students were first years, 30% were sophomores, and 20% were upperclassmen.

::: fragment
80% of the first years didn’t get enough sleep, 40% of the sophomores didn’t get enough sleep, and 10% of the upperclassmen didn’t get enough sleep.

## Bayes' Rule {.smaller}

As we saw before, the two conditional probabilities $P(A | B)$ and $P(B | A)$ are not the same.
But are they related in some way?

::: fragment
Yes they are (!) using **Bayes' rule**:

::: instruction
**Bayes' rule:**

$$\begin{align}P(A | B) &= \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}\\[10pt]
&= \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\end{align}$$
:::
:::

## Bayes' Rule (continued) {.smaller}

Putting together a few rules of probability...

$$\begin{align}P(A | B) &= \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}\\[10pt]
&= \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)}\\[15pt]
&= \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B | A)P(A) + P(B | A^c)P(A^c)}\end{align}$$

Let's took at an example to see how this works.

# Diagnostic Testing

## Definitions {.smaller}

Suppose we're interested in the performance of a diagnostic test.
Let $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease, and let $T$ be the event that the test is positive for that disease.

::: incremental
-   **Prevalence**: $P(D)$
-   **Sensitivity**: $P(T | D)$
-   **Specificity**: $P(T^c | D^c)$
-   **Positive predictive value**: $P(D | T)$
-   **Negative predictive value**: $P(D^c | T^c)$

## Using Bayes' Rule {.smaller}

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
P(D | T) &= \frac{P(D \text{ and } T)}{P(T)}\\
&= \frac{P(T | D)P(D)}{P(T)}\\[5pt]
&= \frac{P(T | D)P(D)}{P(T | D)P(D) + P(T | D^c)P(D^c)}\\[5pt]
&= \frac{P(T | D)P(D)}{P(T | D)P(D) + (1 - P(T^c | D^c))(1 - P(D))}

## A discussion {.smaller}

Think about the following questions:

::: incremental
-   Is this calculation surprising?
-   What is the explanation?
-   Was this calculation actually reasonable to perform?
-   What if we tested in a different population, such as high-risk individuals?
-   What if we were to test a random individual in a county where the prevalence of COVID-19 is approximately 25%?
